                    Some driving schools offer intensive courses, where the theory and practical lessons are completed within a shorter period. Advantages of an intensive course include faster completion of the training and the opportunity to prepare intensively for the driving test in a compact time frame. Intensive courses are especially suitable for people who want to obtain their driver's license quickly and have the necessary time and focus for an intensive learning phase.

                    On the day of the exam, you should be well-rested and focused. Make sure you had a good night's sleep. Bring all the necessary documents, such as your ID card and registration confirmation. Arrive at the exam location on time to avoid stress and, if necessary, coordinate with your driving instructor. Before the practical exam, it is often possible to take a short refresher drive to calm down and adjust. Stay calm and focused during the exam. Mistakes can happen; the important thing is to stay calm and correct them.
